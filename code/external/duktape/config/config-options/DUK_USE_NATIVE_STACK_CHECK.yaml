description: >
  Provide a macro hook to check for available native stack space for the
  currently executing native thread.  The macro must evaluate to zero if
  there is enough stack space available and non-zero otherwise; a RangeError
  will then be thrown.

  The macro is performance sensitive.  It should ideally have a fast path,
  e.g. a stack pointer range comparison, and a slow path handling
  initialization, detecting stack resizes, thread changes, etc.

  The definition of "enough space" depends on the target platform and the
  compiler because the size of native stack frames cannot be easily known
  in advance.  As a relatively safe estimate, one can check for 8kB of
  available stack.

  Duktape doesn't call this macro for every internal native call.  The macro
  is called in code paths that are involved in potentially unlimited
  recursion (such as making Ecmascript/native function calls, invoking
  getters and Proxy traps, and resolving Proxy chains) and code paths
  requiring a lot of stack space temporarily.  Even so the macro is called
  very frequently, and unless the check is fast, performance will be visibly
  impacted.
