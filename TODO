- Create Dialog system. Used for RPG style games
	- Dialog(text)
		- start : render text to bottom of screen
		- next : render next lines of next 		
		- stop : close text box

- Finish and test Sprites

- Create Game making API
	- Simple draw primitives. 
	- sprite creation, map loading
	- background scroll
	- input events (polling)
	- collision events
	

- Background rendering (for parallax)
	- Not tilemap, just large texture. Can scroll

- Tilemap rendering 
	- Create Tilesheet class
	- Create Tile class
	- Create Tilemap class that renders array of tile indices

- Collision system
	- Create collision shapes. (lines, boxes, circles)
	- Dispatch collisions for sprite on (sprite, tile (if collideable), collision_shape)  

- UI System
	- Buttons
	- Text (highlight on select)
	- Menu system 

- Editor

	- Create texture editor, scale up by 4x, create a cursor that "highlights box (create box the is +2 wider/taller " 
	- Background editor 
	- Sprite editor (add animations, edit image)
	- Tilesheet editor 
	- TileMap editor (tile brushes)

- controller input 
	-  keyboard to controller mapping config file

- Create shell
	- show shell input text for "dev debugging" 
	- handle Shift key to get capitilized characters. 
	
- Create toolbar Overlay that persists on editor and Shell
	- tool bar swaps between editors/shell
	- uses buttons and hotkeys
	- When game runs it is hidden. Can be displayed when "start" button is triggered 

- Create AABB collision system
	- use quadtree to resolve collisions. handle both ui and sprite collision with this

- Create Clear Color. In sheeteditor, can erase color. will be transparent


FS - Should handle paths with directory prefix. Asset loading should omit incoming dir  

# Optimizations

Sprite batching. Do not bind the tileset before each draw texture!


Animation to sprite. Create serializable sprites that can be edited in tileset editor. 

Create game editor. This is used to set the tilesets used, maps used, sprites used. 

MOVE ALL TOOLBARS to Main Editor Toolbar
