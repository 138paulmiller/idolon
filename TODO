- Create Dialog system. Used for RPG style games
	- Dialog(text)
		- start : render text to bottom of screen
		- next : render next lines of next 		
		- stop : close text box

- Finish and test Sprites

- Create Game making API
	- Simple draw primitives. 
	- sprite creation, map loading
	- background scroll
	- input events (polling)
	- collision events
	

- Background rendering (for parallax)
	- Not tilemap, just large texture. Can scroll

- Tilemap rendering 
	- Create Tilesheet class
	- Create Tile class
	- Create Tilemap class that renders array of tile indices

- Collision system
	- Create collision shapes. (lines, boxes, circles)
	- Dispatch collisions for sprite on (sprite, tile (if collideable), collision_shape)  

- UI System
	- Buttons
	- Text (highlight on select)
	- Menu system 

- Editor

	- Create texture editor, scale up by 4x, create a cursor that "highlights box (create box the is +2 wider/taller " 
	- Background editor 
	- Sprite editor (add animations, edit image)
	- Tilesheet editor 
	- TileMap editor (tile brushes)

- controller input 
	-  keyboard to controller mapping config file

- Create shell
	- show shell input text for "dev debugging" 
	- handle Shift key to get capitilized characters. 
	
- Create toolbar Overlay that persists on editor and Shell
	- tool bar swaps between editors/shell
	- uses buttons and hotkeys
	- When game runs it is hidden. Can be displayed when "start" button is triggered 

- Create AABB collision system
	- use quadtree to resolve collisions. handle both ui and sprite collision with this
